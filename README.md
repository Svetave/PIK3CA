# Assessment of unresolved PIK3CA gene variants associated with different types of cancer by comparative genomics 

**Spring Project - ITMO 2022**

<br>

The repository includes Straightforward python script for prediction of PIK3CA variants and additional files:

* SF for clinvar variants (PIK3CA).ipynb - jupyter notebook with code for the predictions of PIK3CA variants
* sf1.py - python script for prediction PIK3CA variants (+ additional old version)
* Multiple_alignment.fa - multiple sequence alignment (MAFFT) of the human PIK3CA protein and its orthologues
* PIK3CA_ClinVar.txt - all missense mutations described for PIK3CA in CLinVar
* SF_uncertain.csv - prediction output for PIK3CA ClinVar.txt after SF
* Course - Short results of the project
* Saver-like - SAVER algorithm of variant prediction (https://doi.org/10.1038/gim.2015.208)
